    "### Welcome to the introductory lesson on data science. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses computer science (computational tools), mathematical and statistical knowledge, and domain expertise (area of exploration). Essentially, we are creating and using computational tools to process and analyze huge volumes of data, allowing us to make more informed decisions and/or conclusions that can impacts any aspect of our lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "### One of the most important aspect of data science is the ability to handle large volumes of data. With the vast amount of data that is being collected every second, processing each datapoint manually one by one is an impossible task. This is where computer programs come to the rescue. With only a few lines of code, even the simplest program can help us generate new insights from a large dataset. The focus of the lesson is to learn how to handle and manipulate data, which lays the foundational knowledge set necessary to produce graphical visualizations, conduct statistical analysis, and much more (which would be explored in later lessons).    \n",

    "### Dataset can come is many forms and structures. One common form of storing data is a CSV file. A CSV (comma-separated values) file is a text file where commas are used to separate values. Think of this as a spreadsheet where each individual cell is separated by a comma. When a spreadsheet program (like Excel) open such file, it will know what to display into each individual cell. \n",

This method also accepts absolute paths (starting from the root directory/folder). \n",
