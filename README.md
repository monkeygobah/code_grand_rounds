## Computer Science By Medical Students for Medical Students


Medicine in the 21st century is turning into a computational field! Start here to learn the basics to begin to create or enhance your skillset! This curriculum is good for complete beginners or people with moderate levels of comptutational experience looking to explore new tools.

**[Preface](#preface)**<br>
**[Programming Basics](#programming-basics)**<br>
**[Computer Vision](#computer-vision)**<br>
**[Data Science](#data-science)**<br>
**[Machine Learning](#machine-learning)**<br>
**[Natural Language Processing](#natural-language-processing)**<br>

## Preface

This curriculum is designed to ***augment***  medical (or other graduate training) by making high level topics in computer science approachable. The modules are, by design, project based, as the best way to learn this stuff is to simply work through problems.
By the end, we want you to be able to:
 * Talk about basic computer science toolkits with another computer scientist
 * Read a paper involving computatonal techniques and know roughly what is going on
 * Give you a framework with which to approach your own research/ clinical problems using computer science

### How do I use this resource?

* **If you are brand new to computer science, we reccomend you start at module 1 to get a brief overview of the topics!**

* **If you are interested in data science/ machine learning, after completing module 1 do modules 3 and 4 *in that order*!**

* **Use these notebooks as a starting point and then just start to play on your own!**

> Each module has slides which can be found in the main branch of this repository and can be used for reference as well as attached jupyter notebooks which can be played with on your own time to really start to get a grasp on the topics. we have left some references in each module, but if something is particularly confusing you can use ChatGPT or the internet to pursue it further.

> ANKI CARDS AND Q-BANKS COMING SOON!:D

**If you would like to contribute to the project and giving the lecture series at your university, please get in touch.**

**[To top](#Computer-Science-By-Medical-Students-for-Medical-Students)**<br>

I (GRN) think this should be the bare basics of data science, as to get a full picture on data science you need two lectures to introduce the groundwork and then get into some real applied techniques. I am willing to bet this is something people want the most within the medical sphere, so having two well fleshed out sections makes sense in my brain.
 * Pandas
 * Scikitlearn
 * matplotlib/ seaborn
 * intro level stats
 * linear regression
 * logistic regression
 * different tests
 * manipulation of dfs
 ### Module 3 projects
