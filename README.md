## Module 0
## Preface

This curriculum is designed to ***augment*** another medical (or other graduate training) by introducing high level topics in computer science. By the end, we want you to be able to:
 * Talk about basic computer science toolkits with another computer scientist
 * Read a paper involving computatonal techniques and know roughly what is going on
 * Give you a framework with which to approach your own research/ clinical problems using computer science

### How do I use this resource?

***If you are brand new to computer science, we reccomend you start at module 1 to get a brief overview of the topics!!***

> Each module has slides which can be found in the main branch of this repository and can be used for reference as well as attached jupyter notebooks which can be played with on your own time to really start to get a grasp on the topics. we have left some references in each module, but if something is particularly confusing you can use ChatGPT or the internet to pursue it further.

> ANKI CARDS AND Q-BANKS COMING SOON!:D

**If you would like to contribute to the project, please get in touch.**

 * logistic regression
 * different tests
 * manipulation of dfs

## Module 4
## Machine Learning 
> Goals: Introduce learners to ML in broad strokes to allow people to be conversational and understand use cases of some core algorithms through very simple projects
**4a)  Machine learning vs artificial intelligence**
  * How do we talk about these things
**4b)  Types of machine learning**
  * Supervised learning
  * Unsupervised Learning
  * Semi-Supervised Learning
  * Reinforcement Learning
**4c) How does one start to do machine learning on their data**
  * Review of Data Science lecture
  * Cleaning data
  * Review of matrices 
  * Importance of mathematics but why you dont necesarily need to know it
**4d)  When should I not do machine learning?**
  * Understanding the rules of a system vs unknown systems/ large data
  * Bias and variance 
**4e) Introduction to core shallow algorithms**
  * Decision Trees
  * K nearest neighbors

### Module 4 Projects:
  * UCI heart disease dataset-KNN
  * Microarray malignancy dataset Warnat-Herresthal et al: Unsupervised Clustering

## Module 5
## Natural Language Processing 
*Coming soon....
* not sure we need this?
* Was thinking maybe creation of vector db from some textbook and using gpt api to query
* might be overkill, but also v relevant
