    "The Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm works by fitting the model, evaluating its performance, and then recursively removing the least important features until the desired number of features is left. The criterion for \"importance\" depends on the specific model used. For instance, in the case of logistic regression, it's the absolute values of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, feature selection doesn't always lead to better performance. It is fundamentally a search problem in the space of feature subsets, and there's no guarantee that the search strategy of RFE (or any other feature selection algorithm) will find the optimal subset for your specific model and dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few reasons why your precision did not increase after using RFE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Bias: The RFE algorithm relies on the model for estimating feature importance. If the model has any bias towards certain types of features, RFE might not be able to select the best feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactions Among Features: RFE, in its simplest form, assumes that features contribute to the model independently of each other. If there are important interactions among features, RFE might miss them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting or Underfitting: Selecting fewer features can lead to underfitting if the model becomes too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data. On the other hand, selecting too many features can lead to overfitting, especially if some of the features are noisy or irrelevant."
