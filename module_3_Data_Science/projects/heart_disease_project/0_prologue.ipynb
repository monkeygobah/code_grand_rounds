That said, if you go through this and really make an effort to understand the flow and the techniques you will be in a good position to derive new insights from your own data. Just make sure to always consult with an expert or true statistician when unsure (or even when you think you're sure) as there is a lot of nuance in data science making it as much of an art as a science, and you want to avoid pitfalls!"
