    "# **What even is a Computer?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### First of all, welcome to the first lesson in Code Gramd Rounds! This is the bare basics of the bare basics and is setting the groundwork for what is to come. In Module 0 you will be introduced to the stuff you have to do before you start writing code (what to install, how to set your computer up, etc), but we also wanted to provide some background on computation in general. That is what is going on here! This page is just a rapid fire review of some the anatomy of a computer. While not strictly neccesary and probably not going to come up too often in the course (other than memory- that is really important!) just give this a quick skim to refresh your memory on how computers work at a fundamental level. Admittedly, this is not the most interesting part of Code Grand Rounds, but hey, knowing the basics is always important!\n",

    "## **Operating Systems (OS)**\n",
    "### The Operating System is a software layer that provides essential services and interfaces between user applications and the hardware of the computer system. Operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix handle task scheduling, memory management, and file system management. An OS abstracts and controls hardware, allowing software to function uniformly across different computer architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **CPU vs GPU**\n",
    "### At the heart of every computer lies the Central Processing Unit (CPU), often termed the \"brain\" of the system. It plays a pivotal role in interpreting and executing the vast majority of commands originating from both the computer's hardware and software. The CPU's design is optimized for tasks that require rapid decision-making and diverse functionalities. Its architecture typically encompasses multiple cores, with each core capable of processing instructions concurrently. Several aspects determine a CPU's performance, with clock speed, underlying architecture, and the number of cores being the paramount factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In contrast, the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has its roots in visual computation, originally crafted for rendering images in video games and graphical applications. However, its inherent design, which prioritizes the simultaneous processing of multiple tasks, has propelled the GPU from merely handling visuals to becoming a parallel processing behemoth. Unlike the CPU, a GPU comprises hundreds or even thousands of smaller cores. These cores, while simpler than those in a CPU, are tailored for tasks that can be parallelized, making GPUs particularly adept at handling specific computational workloads, such as deep learning and 3D rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### While both the CPU and GPU are central to computing, their primary difference lies in their approach to processing. The CPU is a generalist, excelling in a variety of tasks that require logic and decision-making. On the other hand, the GPU is a specialist, shining in scenarios where the same operation must be performed on vast amounts of data simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In an evolving technological landscape, both CPUs and GPUs find their unique places, often complementing each other. For many modern applications, harnessing the combined power of both can lead to unprecedented levels of performance and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Random Access Memory (RAM)**\n",
    "### Random Access Memory, commonly referred to as RAM, plays an indispensable role in the overall performance and functionality of a computer system. As a type of volatile memory, its contents evaporate once the system is powered off. Unlike storage devices such as Hard Drives or SSDs, which retain data persistently, RAM is designed for quick read and write access to a specific storage medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One might visualize RAM as a computer's \"short-term memory.\" It holds the data and instructions that the Central Processing Unit (CPU) needs imminent access to. When a computer program runs, it moves data from the long-term storage on the hard drive to the RAM due to the latter's faster access speeds. This ensures that the CPU has quick access to the data it needs to execute commands and run programs efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The significance of RAM becomes even more pronounced when multitasking or running memory-intensive applications. For instance, graphic design software, video editing tools, large-scale simulations, and complex algorithms demand a substantial amount of RAM. Without adequate memory, the system may become sluggish, or applications may crash, leading to lost work and decreased productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the context of algorithms, especially in areas like data analysis or machine learning, the dataset's size can often exceed available RAM. In such cases, algorithms need to be optimized for memory usage, or alternative strategies like disk-based processing or distributed computing might be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Hard Drive (HDD) and Solid State Drive (SSD)**\n",
    "### Both HDDs and SSDs serve as long-term storage devices. HDDs use magnetic storage mechanisms, making them cheaper but slower. SSDs, using NAND-based flash memory, are faster, more energy-efficient, and more durable, albeit at a higher cost per gigabyte.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Cloud**\n",
    "### Cloud computing is a paradigm where computational tasks are executed on remote servers, with the user accessing services via the internet. This model allows for improved efficiency, scalability, and flexibility in computing resources and software delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Software vs. Hardware**\n",
    "### Hardware comprises the physical components of a computerâ€”CPU, RAM, storage devices, and more. Software refers to the collection of instructions and data that the hardware executes and processes. The functional utility of a computer is derived from the synergy between its software and hardware components."
