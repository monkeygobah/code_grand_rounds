### This in on backburner now until we have website and live module 3 completed 

### I think this module should not have a introductory notebook. Instead it should use the same heart disease csv from module 3 and implement SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees. This will be a highly advanced module and optional, but it can serve as a place for those looking to take a deeper dive into data sciemce / statistics to go to.

### If R Folks get to this first, can just convert R-> Python
